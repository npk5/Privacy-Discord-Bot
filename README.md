<h2>Privacy Discord Bot</h2>
Useful if you want to have a server that's basically a bunch of DM channels. Why? Because then people whom you do not share any servers with will be able to join your server just by clicking on a link, without having to add you. All members are kept in separate channels and will not be able to see any other members.
